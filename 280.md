# Strategies of Proofs

\tableofcontents

The following will solely be proofs to exercises from Hammack's "Book of Proof".

## Direct Proof

**Exercises for Chapter 4**

Use the method of direct proof to prove the following statements.

1) If $x$ is an even integer, then $x^{2}$ is even.

**Proof**:

Let $x$ be an arbitrary integer. Suppose $x$ is even. We want to show $x^{2}$ is even. Since $x$ is even, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
x = 2j.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
x^{2} &= (2j)^{2}\\
      &= 4j^{2}\\
      &= 2(2j^{2}).
\end{align*}
Thus, $x^{2}$ is even by definition since $2j^{2}$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

2) If $x$ is an odd integer, then $x^{3}$ is odd.

**Proof**:

Let $x$ be an arbitrary integer. Suppose $x$ is odd. We want to show $x^{3}$ is odd. Since $x$ is odd, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
x = 2j + 1.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
x^{2} &= (2j+1)^{2}\\
      &= 4j^{2} + 4j + 1\\
      &= 2(2j^{2}+2j) + 1.
\end{align*}
Thus, $x^{3}$ is odd by definition since $2j^{2}+2j$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

3) If $a$ is an odd integer, then $a^{2} + 3a + 5$ is odd.

**Proof**:

Let $a$ be an arbitrary integer. Suppose $a$ is odd. We want to show $a^{2} + 3a + 5$ is odd. Since $a$ is odd, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
a = 2j + 1.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
a^{2} + 3a + 5 &= (2j+1)^{2} + 3(2j+1) + 5\\
               &= (4j^{2}+4j+1) + (6j+3) + 5\\
               &= 4j^{2} + 10j + 9\\
               &= 2(2j^{2}+5j+4) + 1.
\end{align*}
Thus, $a^{2} + 3a + 5$ is odd by definition since $2j^{2}+5j+4$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

4) Suppose $x,y\in\Z$. If $x$ and $y$ are odd, then $xy$ is odd.

**Proof**:

Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary integers. Suppose $x$ is odd and $y$ is odd. We want to show $xy$ is odd. Since $x$ is odd, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
x = 2j + 1.
\end{equation*}
Since $y$ is odd, there exists integer $k$ such that
\begin{equation*}
y = 2k + 1.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
xy &= (2j+1)(2k+1)\\
   &= 4jk + 2j + 2k + 1\\
   &= 2(jk+j+k) + 1.
\end{align*}
Thus, $xy$ is odd by definition since $jk+j+k$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

5) Suppose $x,y\in\Z$. If $x$ is even, then $xy$ is even.

**Proof**:

Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary integers. Suppose $x$ is even. We want to show $xy$ is even. Since $x$ is even, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
x = 2j.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
xy &= (2j)y\\
   &= 2jy\\
   &= 2(jy).
\end{align*}
Thus, $xy$ is even by definition since $jy$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

6) Suppose $a,b,c\in\Z$. If $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$, then $a \mid (b+c)$.

**Proof**:

Let $a,b$ and $c$ be arbitrary integers. Suppose $a$ divides $b$ and $a$ divides $c$. We want to show $a$ divides $b+c$. Since $a$ divides $b$, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
b = aj.
\end{equation*}
Since $a$ divides $c$, there exists integer $k$ such that
\begin{equation*}
c = ak.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
b + c &= (aj) + (ak)\\
      &= aj + ak\\
      &= a(j+k).
\end{align*}
Thus, $a$ divides $b$ by definition since $j+k$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

7) Suppose $a,b\in\Z$. If $a \mid b$, then $a^{2} \mid b^{2}$.

**Proof**:

Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary integers. Suppose $a$ divides $b$. We want to show $a^{2}$ divides $b^{2}$. Since $a$ divides $b$, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
b = aj.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
b^{2} &= (aj)^{2}\\
      &= a^{2}j^{2}\\
      &= a^{2}(j^{2}).
\end{align*}
Thus, $a^{2}$ divides $b^{2}$ by definition since $j^{2}$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

8) Suppose $a$ is an integer. If $5 \mid 2a$, then $5 \mid a$.

**Proof**:

Let $a$ be an arbitrary integer. Suppose $5$ divides $2a$. We want to show $5$ divides $a$. Since $5$ divides $2a$, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
2a = 5j.
\end{equation*}
Notice by definition $5j$ is even.
Therefore, there exists integer $k$ such that
\begin{align*}
2a &= 5(2k)\\
   &= 10k\\
   &= 2(5k).
\end{align*}
So,
\begin{equation*}
a = 5k.
\end{equation*}
Thus, $5$ divides $a$ by definition since $k$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

9) Suppose $a$ is an integer. If $7 \mid 4a$, then $7 \mid a$.

**Proof**:

Let $a$ be an arbitrary integer. Suppose $7$ divides $4a$. We want to show $7$ divides $a$. Since $7$ divides $4a$, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
4a = 7j.
\end{equation*}
Observe,
\begin{equation*}
2(2a) = 7j.
\end{equation*}
This means by definition $7j$ is even.
Therefore, there exists integer $k$ such that
\begin{align*}
2(2a) &= 7(2k)\\
      &= 14k\\
      &= 2(7k).
\end{align*}
So,
\begin{equation*}
2a = 7k.
\end{equation*}
Again, by definition $7k$ is even.
Therefore, there exists integer $l$ such that
\begin{align*}
2a &= 7(2l)\\
   &= 14l\\
   &= 2(7l).
\end{align*}
So,
\begin{equation*}
a = 7l.
\end{equation*}
Thus, $7$ divides $a$ by definition since $l$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

10) Suppose $a$ and $b$ are integers. If $a \mid b$, then $a \mid (3b^{3}-b^{2}+5b)$.

**Proof**:

Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary integers. Suppose $a$ divides $b$. We want to show $a$ divides $3b^{3}-b^{2}+5b$. Since $a$ divides $b$, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
b = aj.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
3b^{3} - b^{2} + 5b &= 3(aj)^{3} - (aj)^{2} + 5(aj)\\
                    &= 3a^{3}j^{3} - a^{2}j^{2} + 5aj\\
                    &= a(3a^{2}j^{3}-aj^{2}+5j).
\end{align*}
Thus, $a$ divides $3b^{3}-b^{2}+5b$ by definition since $3a^{2}j^{3}-aj^{2}+5j$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$

11) Suppose $a,b,c,d\in\Z$. If $a \mid b$ and $c \mid d$, then $ac \mid bd$.

**Proof**:

Let $a,b,c$ and $d$ be arbitrary integers. Suppose $a$ divides $b$ and $c$ divides $d$. We want to show $ac$ divides $bd$. Since $a$ divides $b$, there exists integer $j$ such that
\begin{equation*}
b = aj.
\end{equation*}
Since $c$ divides $d$, there exists integer $k$ such that
\begin{equation*}
d = ck.
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{align*}
bd &= (aj)(ck)\\
   &= ajck\\
   &= ac(jk).
\end{align*}
Thus, $ac$ divides $bd$ by definition since $jk$ is an integer.

$\blacksquare$
